# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   **Initial Setup:** Read the README, install dependencies, and run the example for the Online-KNODE-MPC project.

## Recent Changes

*   Created initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## Next Steps

*   Replace the simulation model and controller with a BlueROV model.
*   Update the README and memory bank.
*   Push the changes to the remote repository.

1.  Wait for the BlueROV model to be provided.
2.  Replace the existing quadrotor model with the BlueROV model in `Simulation/quadrotor.py`.
3.  Replace the existing controller model with the BlueROV model in `simulate.py`.
4.  Update the `KNODE/SavedModels/add_model_exp_weighting.pth` with the new BlueROV model.
5.  Update the README to reflect the changes.
6.  Update the memory bank to reflect the changes.
7.  Commit and push the changes to the remote repository.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Following the standard Memory Bank setup procedure before starting the main task.

*This file tracks the current work focus, recent changes, immediate next steps, and any active decisions or considerations.*
