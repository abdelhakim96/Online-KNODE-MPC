# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   **Initial Setup:** Read the README, install dependencies, and run the example for the Online-KNODE-MPC project.

## Recent Changes

*   Created initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## Next Steps

1.  Read `README.md` to understand installation and execution steps.
2.  Identify dependencies listed in the README or project files.
3.  Determine the command(s) needed to install dependencies.
4.  Determine the command(s) needed to run the example.
5.  Execute installation and example commands.
    *   `pip install casadi==3.5.5 numpy==1.23.4 pip==22.3.1 scipy==1.9.3 setuptools==65.5.1 torch==1.13.0 typing_extensions==4.4.0 wheel==0.38.4`
    *   `python3 main.py`

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Following the standard Memory Bank setup procedure before starting the main task.
